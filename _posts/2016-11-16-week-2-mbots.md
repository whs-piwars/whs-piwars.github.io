Thanks to our wonderful team in Finance, our four
[mBot kits](http://www.makeblock.com/mbot-v1-1-stem-educational-robot-kit) arrived in time
for our second meeting.

In the run-up to Christmas, we're hoping to build our mBots and, more importantly, program
them. We'll be focusing on two challenges:

* Line following; 
* Aligning with, and moving along, a wall.

We'll be using the [mBlock programming language](http://www.mblock.cc/) (like Scratch)
because we're more interested in
[computational thinking](http://www.cs4fn.org/computationalthinking/), rather than a specific
language.

_For those of you wondering why we're not going straight to our Raspberry Pi-based robot,_
_we're using the mBots to build our computational thinking first. (Besides, there's only_
_one thing more fun than playing with one robot, and that's playing with lots of them!)_

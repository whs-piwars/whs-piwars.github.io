One of our goals is to keep costs down, and build a robot that's affordable for everyone. Afterall, shouldn't
it be possible to build a robot just by saving your pocket money for a while?

To meet that goal, we're hoping to use a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/)
(for less than £5), rather than a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)
(at around £30). It's also the reason why we've decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for our blog, as they're free to use.

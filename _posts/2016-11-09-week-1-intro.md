Okay, we're started! We've finally had our first meeting!

There are ten members in our team: Hasan, Ibraaheem, Junaid, Milan, Adnan, Isha,
Zenem, Usayd, Mr Ali and Mr Entwisle.

We looked at a number of different robots:

* A Wowwee Rovio, with Omniwheels, which can move in any direction along the ground.
* An mBot, as an example of a two-wheeled robot, with built-in line and ultrasonic sensors.
* Our first prototype of our Raspberry Pi-based robot.

Our protoype uses a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/),
a [Zeroborg motor control board](https://www.piborg.org/zeroborg), and
[a robot chasis kit](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chassis-Strong-Magneto-Encoder-Arduino/dp/B00Q6ZGRYQ) - 
we were able to see the motors running, controlling the program remotely from a
[pi-topCEED](https://www.pi-top.com/product/ceed).

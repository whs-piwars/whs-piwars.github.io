title: Installing Visual Studio Code
tags: []
---

We're planning on using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to allow us to code our robot's [Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) brain remotely from our [Pi TopCEED](https://www.pi-top.com/product/ceed).

Firstly, the latest version of node provided by [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/) lags behind that needed for VS Code, so we need to upgrade it and install some pre-requisites:

``` bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs build-essential libx11-dev
```
Now, we need to download the latest source code for VS Code, and compile it:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode
cd vscode
./scripts/npm.sh install --arch=armhf
```
We're now ready to launch VS Code - the first time we do this, it will take a while as it downloads a few extra things it requires:

``` bash
./scripts/code.sh
```

Finally, we need to edit `product.json` to be able to search for, and add, extensions:

``` json
,"extensionsGallery": {
    "serviceUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/gallery",
    "cacheUrl": "https://vscode.blob.core.windows.net/gallery/index",
    "itemUrl": "https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items"
    }
```
